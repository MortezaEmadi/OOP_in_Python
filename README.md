# OOP_in_Python
<b>Open "OOP.ipynb" in jupyter and watch Dr. Shirafkan's video together; enjoy the extra descriptions in my file.</b><br>
It's a supplementary content to an OOP course in Faradars, taught by Dr. Shirafkan.<br>
I've made so many comments on his contents and cleared the vague points.<br>
