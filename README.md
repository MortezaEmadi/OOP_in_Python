# OOP_in_Python
<b>Open "OOP.ipynb" in jupyter and watch Dr. Shirafkan's video simultaneously; enjoy the extra descriptions in my file.</b><br>
I've made a supplementary training content to an OOP course in Faradars, taught by Dr. Shirafkan.<br>
I've made so many comments on his contents and cleared many vague points.<br>
